The game skyscraper is a logical puzzle made for one player. A district of skyscrapers (for example the district of the Defense) was represented in a railing. Every compartment contains a building of 10, 20, 30, 40, 50 or 60 floors (according to the size of the district). The buildings of the same row, the line or the column, are all of different sizes. The information given to edges indicates the number of visible buildings on the corresponding row by an observer situated in this place.
For example, if a line contains the arrangement 20-40-30-10, two buildings are visible from the left (20 and 40) and three buildings are visible from the right (10, 30 and 40). Find the height of every building !
